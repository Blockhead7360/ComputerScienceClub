  <h1>October 30 2019 - Java 3 (if else statements 2, conditionals)</h1>
  <p>At this meeting, we went over another part of if and else statements along with conditional operators.</p>

  <p><br><br><br></p>

  <h2>If and Else Statements</h2>

  <p>Check out the first part of if and else statements in the <a href="http://repo.blockhead7360.com/ComputerScienceClub/MeetingLogs/10.16.19.html">previous meeting log</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Else If</b>
    <br>
    <br>You can smack an else if in between your if and else to check for other conditions in the same statement. Here's an example:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number >= 20) {
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable is greater than or equal to 20
      <br>
      <br>} else if (number >= 10) {
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here if the number variable is NOT greater than or equal to 20 but IS greater than or equal to 10.
      <br>
      <br>} else {
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable is less than both 20 and 10.
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>//runs code over here no matter what
    </code>
  </p>
    
  <p><br><br><br></p>

  <h2>Conditional Operators</h2>
  <p>Conditional operators compare two sets of comparisons and will only return true if it passes all the statements correctly (you'll see what I mean). You can put the following operators in between two comparisons (see 
    <a href="http://repo.blockhead7360.com/ComputerScienceClub/MeetingLogs/10.16.19.html">relational operators</a>).
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>and</b>
    <br>Using && in between two comparisons will only let the if statement return true if both comparisons are true.
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number == 20 && someOtherNumber >= 4000) {
      <br>
      <br>  //code here only runs if both of those are true
      <br>
      <br>}
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>or</b>
    <br>Using || in between two comparisons will let the if statement return true if at least one of the comparisons is true.
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number == 20 || someOtherNumber >= 4000) {
      <br>
      <br>  //code here will run as long as at least one of those is true
      <br>
      <br>}
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>not</b>
    <br>This is a bit different. Using ! in front of comparisons will return the opposite of what it would normally return.
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (!(someOtherNumber >= 4000) {
      <br>
      <br>  //code here will only run if someOtherNumber is NOT greater than or equal to 4000
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>if (!(number == 20 && someOtherNumber >= 4000) {
      <br>
      <br>  //code here will only run if at least one of those is not true (because when one is not true, then the && makes the whole thing false, but the ! makes it the opposite so false becomes true yay)
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>if (!(number == 20 || someOtherNumber >= 4000) {
      <br>
      <br>  //code here will only run if both of those are false
      <br>
      <br>}
    </code>
