  <h1>October 30 2019 - Java 3 (if else statements 2, conditionals)</h1>
  <p>At this meeting, we went over another part of if and else statements along with conditional operators.</p>

  <h2>If and Else Statements</h2>

  <p>Check out the first part of if and else statements in the <a href="http://repo.blockhead7360.com/ComputerScienceClub/MeetingLogs/10.16.30.html">previous meeting log</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>If</b>
    <br>
    <br>An if statement will check whether a comparison is true and in that case run subsequent code. Here's an example:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number == 20){
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable is 20
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>//runs code over here (outside the if statement) no matter what
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>If Else</b>
    <br>
    <br>Adding an else will let you run code if the if statement isn't true. Here's an example:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number == 20){
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable is 20
      <br>
      <br>} else {
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable isn't 20
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>//runs code over here no matter what
    </code>
  </p>
    
  <p><br><br><br></p>

  <h2>Relational Operators</h2>
  <p>Relational operators compare two things and return a true or false (used best in if statements). You can put the following operators in between two variables or between a variable and a value to compare them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>==</b>
    <br>Checks whether the two are equal to each other.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>&lt or &gt</b>
    <br>Checks whether the left is less/greater than the right.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>&lt= or &gt=</b>
    <br>Checks whether the left is less/greater than or equal to the right.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>!=</b>
    <br>Checks whether the two are NOT equal to each other.
