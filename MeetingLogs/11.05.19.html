  <h1>October 30 2019 - Java 4 (loops, arrays 1)</h1>
  <p>At this meeting, we went over several types of loops and started with some arrays.</p>

  <p><br><br><br></p>

  <h2>Intro to Arrays</h2>

  <p>Arrays are lists of the same data type stored in one variable. For example, you could have an array of 10 integers, meaning there are ten different numbers stored in one variable as a list.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br><b>Defining an array</b>
  <br>An array can be created by using [] next to a data type when creating a variable. You can then place multiple values separated by commas within {} as the value of the array. Like this:
  <br>
  <br>
  
  </p>
    
  <p><br><br><br></p>

  <h2>Conditional Operators</h2>
  <p>Conditional operators compare two sets of comparisons and will only return true if it passes all the statements correctly (you'll see what I mean). You can put the following operators in between two comparisons (see 
    <a href="http://repo.blockhead7360.com/ComputerScienceClub/MeetingLogs/10.16.19.html">relational operators</a>).
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>and</b>
    <br>Using && in between two comparisons will only let the if statement return true if both comparisons are true.
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number == 20 && someOtherNumber >= 4000) {
      <br>
      <br>  //code here only runs if both of those are true
      <br>
      <br>}
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>or</b>
    <br>Using || in between two comparisons will let the if statement return true if at least one of the comparisons is true.
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number == 20 || someOtherNumber >= 4000) {
      <br>
      <br>  //code here will run as long as at least one of those is true
      <br>
      <br>}
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>not</b>
    <br>This is a bit different. Using ! in front of comparisons will return the opposite of what it would normally return.
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (!(someOtherNumber >= 4000) {
      <br>
      <br>  //code here will only run if someOtherNumber is NOT greater than or equal to 4000
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>if (!(number == 20 && someOtherNumber >= 4000) {
      <br>
      <br>  //code here will only run if at least one of those is not true (because when one is not true, then the && makes the whole thing false, but the ! makes it the opposite so false becomes true yay)
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>if (!(number == 20 || someOtherNumber >= 4000) {
      <br>
      <br>  //code here will only run if both of those are false
      <br>
      <br>}
    </code>
