  <h1>November 13 2019 - Java 5 (methods 1, user input)</h1>
  <p>At this meeting, we went over the basics of methods and how to get user input into a program!
    <br>
    <br>I'm doing the meeting logs for both 11/13 and 11/20 at the same time (along with like 3 other ones lol I'm so behind), so we may have done the stuff in the two logs in a different order.

  <h2>Intro to Methods</h2>

  <p>Methods are blocks of code that you can call in your program. All of your functional code has to be inside a method (only variables and classes can be outside).
    <br>(btw, that public static void main thing that we always have, that's a method!)
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Writing and calling a method</b>
    <br>Most of the methods we create will look something like this:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>public void hello() {
      <br>
      <br>}
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>This is a basic method named hello, and within the curly brackets goes your code.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>To call a method, simply use
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>hello();
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>in another part of your code, and the hello method will run. Obviously, if your method isn't named hello, then you'd call it with whatever you named it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Method modifiers</b>
    <br>This is an intro to methods, so for now, you'll know about two of the method modifiers: public and private.
    <br>
    <br>When a method is defined as public, it means that any other class (you'll learn about classes later) can access it.
    <br>
    <br>When a method is defined as private, it means that this method can only be called within your class.
    <br>
    <br>Check out this example:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>public class HelloWorld {
      <br>
      <br>  public void myMethod() {
      <br>
      <br>    System.out.println("dilan!");
      <br>
      <br>  }
      <br>
      <br>  private void myOtherMethod() {
      <br>
      <br>    System.out.println("ranai!");
      <br>
      <br>  }
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>public class ClassyClass {
      <br>
      <br>  public static void main(String[] args) {
      <br>
      <br>    HelloWorld h = new HelloWorld(); //&lt-- you'll learn about this later
      <br>
      <br>    h.myMethod();
      <br>    //this will print dilan! because it's a public method in the other class.
      <br>
      <br>    h.myOtherMethod();
      <br>    //you'll get a thick red underline here because you can't call this private method from this other class.
      <br>
      <br>  }
      <br>
      <br>}
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>Don't understand the example? There is some stuff we haven't learned, but if you have questions on the modifiers, let me know.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Method return type</b>
    <br>You're probably like: okay I kinda get the public private stuff but what the heck is that "void" thing in that line of code? Well, my friend, that's the return type.
    <br>
    <br>In this spot, put whatever object or variable type that you'd want to return from this method. Void means it doesn't return anything and just runs.
    <br>
    <br>Here's an example:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>public void runThis() {
      <br>
      <br>  System.out.println("dilan!");
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>public int getANumber() {
      <br>
      <br>  int number = 0;
      <br>
      <br>  //maybe do stuff with that number
      <br>
      <br>  return number;
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>public String getAWord() {
      <br>
      <br>  return "Computer";
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>public void run() {
      <br>
      <br>  runThis(); //this will print out dilan!
      <br>
      <br>  int i = getANumber(); //this will set whatever number that the getANumber method returns to a variable
      <br>
      <br>  System.out.println(i); //this will print out that number
      <br>
      <br>  System.out.println(getAWord()); //this will print out Computer
      <br>
      <br>}
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>Remember that you can replace the "int" or "String" with any variable type or object in your code.
  </p>

  <h2>User Input (Scanner)</h2>
  
  <p>We're always printing stuff out to the console with System.out, but now let's try allowing the user to type something into the console and using it in the program.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Preparing the scanner</b>
    <br>In your code, let's create a Scanner object. We'll go over how making an object works on a later date, but for now, follow as done below (you can name the variable whatever you want, though):
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>Scanner myscanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Using the scanner for numbers</b>
    <br>Now that we have a scanner named myscanner, we can use it to ask for user input. Watch this:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>System.out.println("Enter a number");
      <br>
      <br>int thatNumber = myscanner.nextInt();
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>When the nextInt method from the scanner is called, the program will pause until the user enters a number into the console.
    <br>
    <br>Now, we have that number stored in our thatNumber variable.
    <br>
    <br>Watch me print out the sum of two user-inputted numbers:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>System.out.println("Enter the first number");
      <br>
      <br>int numberOne = myScanner.nextInt();
      <br>
      <br>System.out.println("Enter the second number");
      <br>
      <br>int numberTwo = myScanner.nextInt();
      <br>
      <br>int total = numberOne + numberTwo;
      <br>
      <br>System.out.println("The total is: " + total);
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>Magic? No, it's science!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Using the scanner for words</b>
    <br>You can get a word from the console by using scanner's next method.
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>String wordInput = myscanner.next();
    </code> 
  </p>
