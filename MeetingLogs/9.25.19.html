<p>Computer Science Club</p>
<h1>September 25, 2019 - Java Introduction</h1>
  
<p>This was our first Computer Science Club meeting (very cool). Here's pretty much what we did.</p>

<h2>Using Eclipse and Java</h2>
  <p><b>About</b>
    <br>
    <br><a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> is an IDE (integrated development environment) that
    allows us to code and compile with ease. We're able to handle our projects more efficiently and code with the help of content
    assist (a heck load of more stuff but for now we don't need to use it all).
  </p>
  <p><b>Projects</b>
    <br>
    <br>Create a project by right clicking on the 'Projects' view on the left -> New -> Java Project
    <br>Enter a name that you'd want to use and hit [Enter]. This name is only for your reference and won't be in any part of your actual program.
