<p>Computer Science Club</p>
<h1>September 25, 2019 - Java Introduction</h1>
  
<p>This was our first Computer Science Club meeting (very cool). Here's pretty much what we did (sorry this might be tedious to read but like just show up to the meetings and you won't have to).</p>



<h2>Using Eclipse and Java</h2>

<b>About</b>

<a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> is an IDE (integrated development environment) that
allows us to code and compile with ease. We're able to handle our projects more efficiently and code with the help of content
assist (a heck load of more stuff but for now we don't need to use it all).


<b>Projects</b>
  
Create a project by right clicking on the 'Projects' view on the left -> New -> Java Project
Enter a name that you'd want to use and hit [Enter]. This name is only for your reference and won't be in any part of your actual program.


<b>Packages</b>
  
Packages are like folders (for what we're doing right now). Create a package by right clicking on 'src' within your project -> New -> Package

Naming packages usually follow certain naming conventions. They look like a URL backwards, followed by a project identifier, followed by an optional category.
    <i>(example: com.google.myproject and com.google.myproject.utilities)</i>


<b>Classes</b>

Classes are where all of your code is run from. We'll get into more details later, but for now, you just need a few to run basic code.
Classes follow naming conventions as well: they must start with a CAPITAL LETTER and have no spaces.
    <i>(example: HelloWorld)</i>



<h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
<b>What is Java</b>

It's an object-oriented programming language (good for basics but also very useful in the future). Like literally pretty much everything runs Java (television, computer, etc.
  

<b>The Main Method </b>

Your Java program needs to have a main method. We'll go into detail about what each of the modifiers mean, but for now, you'll just need to copy exactly as shown below:

    <code>public static void main(String[] args){<br><br><br>}</code>
    
Enter a name that you'd want to use and hit [Enter]. This name is only for your reference and won't be in any part of your actual program.
