<p>Computer Science Club</p>
<h1>September 25, 2019 - Java Introduction</h1>
  
<p>This was our first Computer Science Club meeting (very cool). Here's pretty much what we did.</p>

<h2>Using Eclipse</h2>
  <p>
    <b>About</b>
    <br>
    <br><a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> is an IDE (integrated development environment) that
    allows us to code and compile with ease. We're able to handle our projects more efficiently and code with the help of content
    assist (a heck load of more stuff but for now we don't need to use it all).
    <br>
    <br><b>Creating a project with classes</b>
    <br>
    <br>1. Open Eclipse. If it's your first time opening the workspace, you'll see a 'Welcome' tab. Just close out of that tab.
    <br>
    <br>2. Right click within the 'Projects' view on the left -> New -> Java Project
    <br>    -> Project names do not have to be anything specific. They'll never be displayed in your program or code. They're only
    stored in eclipse and are for your use.
    <br>
    <br>4. Open the project within the 'Projects' view - > Right click on 'src' (source) -> New -> Package
    <br>    -> Package names usually follow a naming convention. These may be seen depending on what your program is used for.
    <br>    -> Typically, they look like a URL backwards, followed by a project name, followed by a category: <i>com.google.myproject.utilities</i>
    <br>    -> Since we aren't into package protected classes or methods, you can use packages as a way to sort your classes.
    <br>
    <br>5. Right click on the package -> New -> Class
    <br>    -> Classes are where all your main code is written and run from. We'll get more into this later, but for now, you just need one.
    <br>    -> These also follow naming conventions that are slightly more strict.
    <br>    -> The name should start with a CAPITAL LETTER and should not have any spaces. Eclipse will tell you if you aren't making it right.
    <br>
    <br>And there ya go
