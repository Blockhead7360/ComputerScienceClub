  <h1>November 20 2019 - Challenge 1 (adding addiction!), Java 6 (methods 2)</h1>
  <p>At this meeting, we did the first challenge and some more stuff with methods.
    <br>
    <br>I'm doing the meeting logs for both 11/13 and 11/20 at the same time (along with like 3 other ones lol I'm so behind), so we may have done the stuff in the two logs in a different order.

  <h2>Adding Addiction! - Challenge 1</h2>

  <p>Use your knowledge of arrays, user input, loops (optional), and other stuff to take 5 numbers from the user and print out their sum.
  </p>

  <h2>User Input (Scanner)</h2>
  
  <p>We're always printing stuff out to the console with System.out, but now let's try allowing the user to type something into the console and using it in the program.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Preparing the scanner</b>
    <br>In your code, let's create a Scanner object. We'll go over how making an object works on a later date, but for now, follow as done below (you can name the variable whatever you want, though):
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>Scanner myscanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Using the scanner for numbers</b>
    <br>Now that we have a scanner named myscanner, we can use it to ask for user input. Watch this:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>System.out.println("Enter a number");
      <br>
      <br>int thatNumber = myscanner.nextInt();
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>When the nextInt method from the scanner is called, the program will pause until the user enters a number into the console.
    <br>
    <br>Now, we have that number stored in our thatNumber variable.
    <br>
    <br>Watch me print out the sum of two user-inputted numbers:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>System.out.println("Enter the first number");
      <br>
      <br>int numberOne = myScanner.nextInt();
      <br>
      <br>System.out.println("Enter the second number");
      <br>
      <br>int numberTwo = myScanner.nextInt();
      <br>
      <br>int total = numberOne + numberTwo;
      <br>
      <br>System.out.println("The total is: " + total);
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>Magic? No, it's science!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Using the scanner for words</b>
    <br>You can get a word from the console by using scanner's next method.
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>String wordInput = myscanner.next();
    </code> 
  </p>
