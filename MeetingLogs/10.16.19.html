  <h1>October 16, 2019 - Java 2 (if else statements 1, relationals)</h1>
  <p>At this meeting, we went over part of if and else statements along with relational operators.</p>

  <p><br><br><br></p>

  <h2>If and Else Statements</h2>

  <p><b>If</b>
    <br>
    <br>An if statement will check whether a comparison is true and in that case run subsequent code. Here's an example:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number == 20){
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable is 20
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>//runs code over here (outside the if statement) no matter what
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>If Else</b>
    <br>
    <br>Adding an else will let you run code if the if statement isn't true. Here's an example:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number == 20){
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable is 20
      <br>
      <br>} else {
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable isn't 20
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>//runs code over here no matter what
    </code>
  </p>

  <h2>Relational Operators</h2>

  <h2>The Main Method</h2>
  <p>Your Java program needs to have a main method. We'll go into detail about what each of the modifiers mean, but for now, you'll just need to copy exactly as shown below:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      public static void main(String[] args){
    
      }
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>This is where your code will start running from when the program is run. It'll start with the first line of this method and continue by reading from left to right top to bottom.  
  </p>
  
  <h2>Data Types and Variables</h2>
  <p><b>About Data Types</b>
    <br>
    <br>There are a lot of different variable types you can create. You store values and content in variables, by the way. See below for a bunch of the common ones.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Initializing them with code</b>
    <br>
    <br>To create a variable, you'd type it out like so:
    <br>
    <code>
      String hello = "Hello world!";
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>Where "String" is the data type (see below), "hello" is the identifier of the variable (this can be whatever you want, everytime you use this variable in your code, you'll refer
    to it with this name), "=" means your assigning the value on the right to the variable on the left, and "Hello world!" is replaced with an appropriate value.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>String</b>
    <br>A String is any piece of text (can include letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, etc.).
    <br>Must be surrounded by double quotation marks "
    <br>
    <code>
      String myAddress = "1 Apple Park Way";
    </code>
    <br>
    <br><b>int</b>
    <br>An int is an integer (any full number). It can be negative but no decimals.
    <br>
    <code>
      int numberOfEmployees = 12000;
    </code>
    <br>
    <br><b>boolean</b>
    <br>A boolean can only be true or false.
    <br>
    <code>
      boolean isCool = true;
    </code>
    <br>
    <br><b>double</b>
    <br>A double is any number including a decimal point. If you set it to a whole number, it will automatically include the .0 when used.
    <br>
    <code>
      double revenueInBillions = 258.5;
    </code>
    <br>
    <br><b>char</b>
    <br>A char is a character (only one letter, number, symbol, etc.).
    <br>Must be surrounded by single quotation marks '
    <br>
    <code>
      char firstLetter = 'A';
    </code>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Printing to the Console</h2>
  <p>You can print to the console by using the following line of code:
    <br>
    <code>
      System.out.println(&ltvariable&gt);
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>Replace &ltvariable&gt with either the variable identifier to print out or any value.
  </p>
