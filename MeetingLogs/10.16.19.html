  <h1>October 16 2019 - Java 2 (if else statements 1, relationals)</h1>
  <p>At this meeting, we went over part of if and else statements along with relational operators.</p>

  <h2>If and Else Statements</h2>

  <p><b>If</b>
    <br>
    <br>An if statement will check whether a comparison is true and in that case run subsequent code. Here's an example:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number == 20){
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable is 20
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>//runs code over here (outside the if statement) no matter what
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>Else</b>
    <br>
    <br>Adding an else will let you run code if the if statement isn't true. Here's an example:
    <br>
    <br>
    <code>
      if (number == 20){
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable is 20
      <br>
      <br>} else {
      <br>
      <br>  //runs whatever's in here only if the number variable isn't 20
      <br>
      <br>}
      <br>
      <br>//runs code over here no matter what
    </code>
  </p>

  <h2>Relational Operators</h2>
  <p>Relational operators compare two things and return a true or false (used best in if statements). You can put the following operators in between two variables or between a variable and a value to compare them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>==</b>
    <br>Checks whether the two are equal to each other.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>&lt</b> or <b>&gt</b>
    <br>Checks whether the left is less/greater than the right.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>&lt=</b> or <b>&gt=</b>
    <br>Checks whether the left is less/greater than or equal to the right.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><b>!=</b>
    <br>Checks whether the two are NOT equal to each other.
