  <h1>February 04 2020 - Game Development 1 (basic setup 1)</h1>
  <p>Welcome! If you miss meetings, make sure to check out these logs to get an overview of what we did. All of the source files will also be here.
    <br>
    <br>Also, I won't explain all parts of the code in these logs. If you would like to know how each thing works or if you have any questions, contact me or talk to me at a meeting.
    <br>
    <br>At this meeting, we created a blank basic ticking and rendering system for the game, along with an application window (to eventually put the game and all the graphics in).
