  <p>A new website might be currently in development idk now that school's cancelled.
    <br>
    <br>If you want to, check out the <a href="http://dilanmail.com/csclub">old website</a> which also hasn't been updated since like August of 2019.
    <br>By the way, that website will no longer be accessible after April 4, 2021. Hopefully by then I (or the new president since I'll be graduating) will have created something new.
    <br>That's a freaking year, so like come on dude something should be up by then.
    <br>
    <br>Are you interested in merchandise????? <a href="http://merch.pvcs.club">merch.pvcs.club</a>
    <br>We'll probably get it some time next year. The sign up is just to state your interest. You won't have to pay for anything unless merch delivery is confirmed.
    <br>
    <br>If you have any questions about the club or coding or anything, shoot me an email at dilan@dilanmail.com. Bye ;)
